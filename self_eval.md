# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
Honestly really excited about what I feel I'm capable of even after these few busy weeks. Being able to look at the method challenges in the final_practice.rb and just using what I've learned about the language and how to work through it constructively is so fun!
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
Methods allow us to fully utilize ruby's engine and consolidate code by making it efficient.
